          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Hey! I'm Jeseekia and I love web development. This is a site I am building alongside the TreeHouse course "How to Make a Website". Although I already have the basic skills in this course, I believe you never can get too much practice.
            It is the first of many projects that I am building in my own #greenheatmap challange. After going back and forth on all types of growth goals that I want to accomplish I decided I should focus on one simple goal: to have an all green contributions
          graph on Github. I decided that if I could accomplish this, the many different things I hope to know and get better at will naturally come with daily commits to various repositories. In the short term I plan to finish the Frontend Development track
        as well as the Full-Stack JavaScript track on TreeHouse. a few months down the line I hope to complete some Python courses and projects, build a Twitter bot, and contribute to some of my favorite open source projects among other things.</p>
        <p>I am a senior Mechanical Engineering student, a Co-Organizer for Girl Develop It Detroit, and teach intro JavaScript courses among other things. Check out my personal site http://www.metadevgirl.com then follow me on Twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/metadevgirl">@metadevgirl</a> and hold me accountable on Github <a href="http://www.github.com/jeseekia">@jeseekia!</a></p>
